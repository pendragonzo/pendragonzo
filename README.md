### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**pendragonzo/pendragonzo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. 

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a text editor
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on absolutely nothing
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with absolutely nothing
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why i am trying to learn how to code by hacking things together until it all makes sense
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@pendragonzo](https://twitter.com/pendragonzo)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they / them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a (relatively) normal person that does (relatively) normal things. I'm just a little private. I just don't like the internet (and you) knowing too much about me. Because it doesn't allow me to make mistakes that I can learn from without keeping them forever. Oh, and all that bit about using my data without my permission / paying me.
